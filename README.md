# Interactive-Light-Painting-Device-Using-Arduino
This guide will walk you through building an interactive light painting device using an Arduino, RGB LEDs (NeoPixel), and an accelerometer. The system creates dynamic light effects when motion is detected, allowing users to "paint" with light in long-exposure photography.
